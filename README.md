My codes for the R course homework 

Week 3: In this course, I learned how to load and manipulate data in R using functions like `vroom()` and the magrittr pipe (`%>%`). Key skills included cleaning data, identifying issues like inconsistent country names, and summarizing data (e.g., total deaths) using `group_by()`. I also gained experience with visualizing data through various plots, using geoms for different types, and creating grouped or faceted plots to compare data across categories.

Week 4: Here, I refreshed my understanding of basic statistics, including normal distribution and comparing means. I learned how to assess whether data follows a normal distribution and how to analyze normally distributed data. Additionally, I conducted t-tests to compare means and interpreted the results, gaining hands-on experience with statistical analysis.

Week 5: In this course, I learned about Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and how they extend simple statistical methods like linear regression to handle different types of data. I explored concepts such as error distributions, link functions, and how to choose appropriate error distributions for non-normally distributed data, particularly for count data. I also gained experience in fitting GLMs, visualizing residuals, evaluating model fit, comparing alternative models, and interpreting model summaries.
